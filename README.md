# Tube Departure Board
See when the tube is coming - an experimental project mainly for me to learn how the TfL open data API works.

###Setup Instructions
This app uses the TfL API. In order to run it yourself you will need to acquire an API key by registering at http://api.tfl.gov.uk/

You will need to set the following configuration in the application.properties file:
- api.tfl.gov.uk.id - your TfL app_id
- api.tfl.gov.uk.key - your TfL app_key
